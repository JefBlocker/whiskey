We suggest learning more if you have specific questions. Here are some helpful tips we found online (this is just a general summary of information and not meant to be complete):\r\n\r\n\u2022 As the barrels are a wood product, they are subject to the wood drying and shrinking.\r\n\u2022 In order for the spigot to flow freely, please remember to remove the bung\/cork before you open the spigot ... pour from the spigot ... then close the spigot and finally ... replace the bung\/cork. \r\n\u2022 To keep your barrels performing and looking their best, please keep them stored in a protected area away from the elements and optimally in a cool and relatively humid area. \r\n\u2022 Barrels with painted black steel hoops are particularly susceptible to moisture. A little care goes a long way. Prevent excessive staining and rust by keeping the exterior of the barrel dry.\r\n\u2022 Avoid water stains by using a funnel to carefully fill your new barrel. \r\n\u2022 Sandpaper will generally remove any stains or marks on the barrel. \r\n\u2022 As the barrels are handcrafted, liquid volume is approximate. \r\n\u2022 You should be able to reuse your barrel from 3-5 times ... remember that each aging will take longer than the previous one. \r\n\u2022 Please do not nail or put screws into the hoops or staves as doing so will compromise the oak and might cause damage. \r\n\u2022 If you want to age a different type of spirit then was initially aged in it, we recommend you use a new barrel. \r\n\u2022 For your safety, if using chemicals to clean\/sanitize your barrels, please follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for proper use.\r\n\u2022 The spirit can age anywhere from one week to one-year, but it&#39;s recommended that you take a small taste test every two weeks.  Remember to only take a small taste to ensure the top of the barrel does not get dry to avoid leaking and losing your spirit to the &#39;Angel&#39;s Share.&#39;  Once the spirit reaches your perfect taste, empty the spirit into a decanter and restart the process!\r\n\r\nAngel\u2019s Share.\r\nAngel\u2019s Share is a fancy name for evaporation. Since mini-barrel staves are thinner than normal distillery size 53-gallon barrel staves, there is a higher \u201cangel\u2019s share\u201d, thus higher evaporation. To avoid this evaporation, make sure you follow the instructions and 1) fill the barrel to the very top when first filling the barrel with your spirit; and 2) keep the top of the barrel moist after using the barrel by rolling the liquid around every couple of days. As previously mentioned, we recommend taking very small taste-tests every two weeks to ensure much of the top of the barrel does not become dry.&quot;\r\n\r\nStoring your Empty Barrel After Initial Use \r\nIdeally, your barrel would always be filled. Used barrels require no special preparation beyond a simple water rinse, if desired, when transferring out and in immediately. If used barrels are to be stored empty, rinse them several times with clean water, and drain thoroughly. Remove the spigot and bung to promote air flow and store out of sunlight and in a cool (55\u00b0 \u2013 60\u00b0) and optimally humid (65% - 75%) area. \r\n\r\nAn alternative is to fill and store barrels with a sulfur-citric holding solution (recipes are online). This holding solution promotes sanitation and keeps the barrels swelled and smelling sweet however ... it will strip some of the oaks flavors. For your safety and the safety of your family, always follow manufacturers\u2019 guidelines and instructions for the proper use of chemicals. \r\n\r\n","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1425221647,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SummitEngravingLtd?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/033\/0\/9052662\/iusb_760x100.14372376_mdth.jpg","num_favorers":566,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":null}},{"listing_id":217006470,"state":"active","user_id":12350222,"category_id":69150425,"title":"Coffee Mug, This Probably Is Whiskey Mug, Ceramic Mug, Quote Mug, Married in May, Unique Coffee Mug Gift Coffee, Gift Idea for Him","description":"Introducing your new favorite Monday mug!

This is done on the eve of your wedding day. Each letter then gets sealed in its own envelope. \n\nDuring the ceremony the Bride and Groom put their letters in the box with the wine and lock it. \n\nYou set an anniversary to open it. Maybe even engrave the date to be opened on the box.

These are typically set up to printed on a standard letter sized sheet and each label should be cut to approximately 4&quot; x 3.25&quot;. \r\n\r\nTypically you can use a full shipping label and have it printed on any commercial printer. For instance Office Depot, etc all can print for $0.70 per copy and can even cut it for you!  Or you can send the file to a printer and they will print on cut on their professional machines.   \r\n\r\nIf you are printing labels instead of tags I do not suggest purchasing pre-cut (Avery for instance) labels and attempting to line up the file to their layout.  It is definitely easiest to print the file on a full sheet and cut to your dimensions!\r\n\r\nHope they are a hit!\r\nRachel","last_updated_tsz":1444402919,"listing_active_count":133,"login_name":"RDMULLET","accepts_custom_requests":false,"policy_welcome":"Thank you for visiting my shop!  Feel free to look around at the many designs I have.  Stay tuned...more designs for all occasions coming soon!","policy_payment":null,"policy_shipping":"Standard orders in the US ship in 2 business days and are typically 3-5 business days once shipped (or 5-7 business days to your door from the time of placing your order.) \r\n\r\nI also offer 3 expedited services you can choose at check out. \r\n\r\n1)  PRIORITY SHIPPING $3.50 upgrade-  Typically 4-6 business days to your door.\r\n2)  RUSH $12.00 upgrade - Ships next business day PRIORITY  Typically 3-4 business days to your door from placing order.  Insurance included.\r\n3)  EXPRESS $26.45 upgrade - Next day (or same day if possible) turnaround and EXPRESS shipping (typically 1-2 day service).  1-3 days to your door from placing order.  Insurance Included.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind RUSH EXPRESS is the only shipping option guaranteed by USPS!  You can purchase any of these shipping upgrades at check-out under &quot;Shipping&quot; if needed.\r\n\r\nINSURANCE: Please note that PRIORITY, RUSH & EXPRESS services include insurance for lost or damaged mail.  Standard shipping does NOT include insurance.  Please purchase an upgraded shipping option if you wish to insure your package!\r\n\r\nUSPS and I have a love\/hate relationship.  I love their prices (and so do you) but I hate it when they don&#39;t deliver on time.  Ug.  Which takes me to my next point--\r\nUSPS DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY SHIPPING TIMES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPRESS.  Sad but true.  Express in most cases, is overnight delivery and is a flat rate of $21.45 to US residents.  For those of you willing to fork it over, please message me for Express delivery option.  Keep in mind if you need 2 day turnaround to your door--you&#39;d need to purchase the RUSH option as well.  This bumps you to the front of every line.\r\n\r\nUSPS recognizes M-F as considered &quot;Postal Business Days&quot;.  Please keep this in mind when doing the math on when to expect your order!\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell:\r\n\r\nStandard Shipping (4-6 business days to your door)\r\nRUSH Shipping (3-4 business days to your door)\r\nEXPRESS Shipping (2 business days to your door excluding extreme rural areas which is 3 business days) USPS guarantees this method or your shipping money back.  Purchase an upgraded shipping option to insure your package.\r\n\r\nI have had very few issues with the USPS however it does happen.  Typically 5 out of every 100.  I take a lot of pride in my labels as they are all edited one at a time--Trust me when I say I would hand deliver them if I could! :)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\r\nInternational shipping is typically 2-3 weeks depending on its destination and how long it takes to process through customs (which always varies.)  USPS does not guarantee these shipping times and from time-to-time there are significant delays in Customs.  USPS does offer guaranteed services (which are super expensive but again, guaranteed.)  Please message me directly if you are interested in International guaranteed USPS delivery. \r\n\r\n7-11 Day RUSH International Ship (Business Days) \t$30.50 USD\r\n9-14 Day International Shipping (Business Days) \t$25.50 USDD\r\n4-6 Day RUSH International Shipping \t$45.75 USD\r\n\r\n***PLEASE NOTE from time to time International buyers are forced to pay customs fees and\/or taxes that are levied on many packages being imported into some countries.  Because sellers are unable to predict what fees, if any, certain countries will apply, Etsy does not hold sellers responsible for unexpected customs fees or taxes.  In my experience I have only seen this through Royal Mail.  Just a heads up!","policy_refunds":"No refunds offered once the design process has begun.

The inspiration for my items revolves around the bodhisattva associated with compassion, known as Guanyin. She has definitely played a large role in my life and the way that I live it. Hence, the need to bring a peace of mind to those who are in need of healing. That is where my bracelets, earrings, necklaces, etc.. come into play. \r\n\r\nI feel deep down inside that the power of semi-precious stones and the colors we wear play a significant and integral role in our lives. As human beings, each day we go through so many emotions that sometimes we lose track of them. Therefore, we have emotions\/feelings that happen more than others, good and bad. Because of that, sometimes we just need a little help to overcome the bad ones or a little extra boost for the good ones. \r\n\r\nTherefore, each piece is made with special love, care and positive energy.    \r\n\r\nAll jewelry is made specially by me.\r\n\r\nEach piece is made at the time of purchase. Therefore, each piece is unique and may not be exactly as represented in the photograph if they are multicolored stones in a single bracelet. \r\n\r\nThere are many different categories, so feel free to look around! I do custom orders as well. \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nFINDING THE PERFECT BRACELET SIZE:\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\nMy wrist is about 5 3\/4 in. - 6 in. The perfect size would be about  6 1\/2 in or a little over 6 in.\r\n\r\nBasically, a snug fit bracelet would be about 1\/2 an inch larger. \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nBRACELET MEASUREMENTS:\r\nIf not stated in the profile: \r\nStandard size for bracelets are 7 in. \r\nMen&#39;s bracelets are 8 in.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING POLICY:\r\nWe ship most everything standard shipping. \r\nHowever, we do provide priority mail upon request! :)\r\nUS Shipping is $3.50. International & Canada is a one time flat rate of $9.00\r\n\r\nMAKE YOUR OWN:\r\nSomething New! You can now have the option to choose which Semi precious gemstones or pearls that you would like to have in a combination bracelet. An easy way is to purchase the ones you would like and mention in a note the type of bracelet combination you want, single band or double band. I will make the bracelet, send you a photo of the final product and once approved, it will be shipped as soon \r\n\r\nMESSAGES:\r\nI will answer messages within 24-48 hours of receiving the message.

Horween is one of the oldest and most respected tanneries in the United States and makes some of the best leather available. These watch bands are made right here in Texas and sourced from materials right here in the US (aside from the Apple Watch adapter).\nWe made these leather straps because there only seemed to be lower quality leather options out there for the Apple Watch and we wanted to show off the Apple Watch in the best way possible.\nHorween&#39;s Chromexcel leather is arguably one of the best leathers that money can buy and that will beautifully age with character over time. Chromexcel is the original pull-up leather; using time honored techniques and formulas that were developed nearly 100 years ago.\n\nLeather Color - Whiskey Brown\nBuckle\/Loops Color - Black PVD (see fourth photo)\nThread Color - Please add a note of the thread color you&#39;d like from the following options: black, brown, natural, mocha, scarlet, or white\n\nFeatures\n\n\u2022 Horween Chromexcel

loops\n\nSizes\nOur sizes are relative to the standard Apple Watch sport band offered from Apple, please order according to which sport band fits you best.\n\nAdapters\nThe included Apple Watch adapters come in two colors: black and silver\n\nWe recommend ordering the black color adapter if your Apple Watch model is &quot;space grey&quot; or &quot;space black.&quot; We recommend ordering the silver color adapter is your Apple Watch model is the stainless steel or aluminum grey.\n\n\nThese bands are custom made and may take up to 3-5 business days to make for you.\n\n*The Apple Watch in
